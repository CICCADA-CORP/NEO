[![Spec Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/spec-v0.1--draft-yellow.svg)](./SPECIFICATION.md)

**An open-source, public domain audio format that natively supports multi-stem architecture, neural compression, smart metadata, spatial audio, P2P streaming, and non-destructive editing.**

*One file to rule them all — production, distribution, playback, and archival.*

## 🎯 Why NEO?

Current audio formats were designed in the 1990s for a simpler world. They store **flat**, **single-stream** audio with basic metadata. NEO reimagines audio from the ground up:

| Capability | MP3/AAC | FLAC/WAV | NI Stems | **NEO** |
|-----------|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Multi-stem (vocals, drums, bass...) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (4 fixed) | ✅ **(1-8 dynamic)** |
| AI neural compression (90x ratio) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Bit-perfect lossless mode | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ **(hybrid)** |
| 3D spatial audio (object-based) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Provenance / anti-deepfake (C2PA) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Smart metadata (JSON-LD) | ID3 tags | Vorbis | MP4 | ✅ **(linked data)** |
| Temporal lyrics + chords + BPM | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Web3 royalties / direct payment | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| P2P / IPFS native streaming | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Non-destructive edit history | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **(git-like)** |
| Progressive loading (instant play) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Open source / patent-free | Expired | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ **(Unlicense)** |

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎚️ Stem-Native Architecture
Every `.neo` file can contain up to 8 separate audio stems (vocals, drums, bass, melody, etc.). Mute the vocals for instant karaoke. Isolate the drums for sampling. Or listen to the full mix — all from one file.

### 🧠 Neural Compression (DAC)
Powered by the Descript Audio Codec, NEO achieves **~90x compression** at perceptual transparency. Combined with a FLAC residual layer, you get **lossy streaming AND lossless archival** in the same file.

### 🌐 Object-Based Spatial Audio
Audio stems are positioned in 3D space as objects. Your player automatically renders them for headphones (binaural/HRTF), surround systems (5.1/7.1.4), or stereo — no re-mastering needed.

### 🔐 Content Credentials (C2PA)
Cryptographic signatures prove whether a track is human-made, AI-generated, or a hybrid. Fight deepfakes and verify authenticity at the format level.

### ⚡ Progressive Loading
Start playing instantly with the embedded ultra-light preview. Higher-quality layers download in the background. Zero buffering, even on 4G.

### 📝 Git-Like Edit History
Cut the intro? Boost the bass? Your edits are stored as metadata — the original audio is never touched. Revert to any version, like git for audio.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust 1.75+](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/) (for neural codec components)

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/neo-codec.git
cd neo-codec

# Build the Rust workspace
cd crates
cargo build --release

# The CLI tool is at target/release/neo
./target/release/neo --help
```

### Usage

```bash
# Encode a WAV file with 2 stems
neo encode vocals.wav instrumental.wav -o track.neo --stems vocals,instrumental

# Decode back to WAV
neo decode track.neo -o output/ --all-stems

# Inspect file info
neo info track.neo

# Play with stem control
neo play track.neo --mute vocals    # Instant karaoke!
neo play track.neo --solo drums     # Isolate drums

# Tag with metadata
neo tag track.neo --title "My Song" --artist "My Band" --bpm 120 --key Cm

# Download AI models
neo model download 44khz
```
